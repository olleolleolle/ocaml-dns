(** The pure interface to the client part of uDns.

    Various helper modules to do with side effects are available from
    {!Dns_client_lwt}, {!Dns_client_unix} and so forth.

    To learn more about the high-level API, I suggest reading the docstrings
    of {!Dns_client_flow}.

(** [query_state] is parameterized over the query type, so the type of
    the representation of the answer depends on what the name server
    was asked to provide. See {!Dns_map.k} for a list of response types.
    The first element (the [int32]) in most of the tuples is the
    Time-To-Live (TTL) field returned from the server, which you can use to
    calculate when you should request fresh information in case you are writing
    a long-running application.

    [response] parsed using [query_state] when the query was successful, or
    an [`Msg message] if the [response] did not match the [query_state]

    In a TCP usage context the [`Partial] means there are more packets.
    In a UDP usage context the [`Partial] means information was lost, due to an
    incomplete packet.
